## Aquaculture with Rainwater pumping station

Marine pollution. It's a big social problem. This project is a vertical fish farm proposed to address various marine pollution problems and improve the supply of seafood in Seoul. Through a style combined with housing, we aim to build a circular ecosystem where production and consumption occur together, rather than only consumption within the building. We expect this to have a positive psychological and economic impact on residents.

This building is expected to not only achieve internal circulation, but also contribute to improving the water quality of the Han River by analyzing the existing water infrastructure connected to the Han River. The overall building system was constructed by focusing on the intersection of the structure of the rainwater pumping station and the vertical aquaculture system. Therefore, Eungbong Rainwater Pump Station was selected as the site.

We wanted to incorporate natural patterns into the building, rather than the existing fish farms that were separated by floor in people's spaces to maximize efficiency. We also wanted to make this space blend well into the surrounding environment without being alien to Seoul's environment and systems. Therefore, we included residential facilities along with programs such as markets and research facilities.Through this, we aim to utilize existing systems to create a building that is integrated into Seoul's environment and systems.
